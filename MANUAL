Thanx for taking MAW-GRUB. I hope you're happy now.

Anyway, this is basically an automatic GRUB file generator that will generate things like a logon menu, easier bootloader entries, and etc. all in one file! And that file is... YAML!

After configuring everything you want (take a look at maw.example.conf), copy your "maw.conf" to /boot/maw.conf. Link "maw.rb" to /usr/local/bin/maw and the "maw-*" files to /usr/local/sbin/maw-* Now:

# maw-genlogon
# maw-genmenu

And we're ready! Reboot, and you'll get a logon screen! Now press 'p', enter your password. Now we're at an automatically generated main menu! Select, and boot.

AUTOBOOT is currently not finished, to use it you will have to add an INITscript that runs maw-genlogon. You will have to do that yourself, for now. I did include one for Arch Linux, if you're interested though...

Anyway, everything works as I want it for now. Any complaints? Just message me on twitter (devynci) or GitHub (devyn)
